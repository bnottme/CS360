---Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this application was to design an event-tracking application. The user needed to be able to create an account, create an event, and receive SMS messages.

---What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Multiple screens were needed to complete these features. 
There needed to be a login page to input a username and password and a create account page. There also needed to be an SMS agreement for the user to sign up for notifications. After the user was brought to a screen where the events were shown, they could press a button to be taken to a screen where they could input details of an event. They would then be brought back to the screen where they could see all events created.

To support users' needs, I kept my application as simple and user-friendly as possible to enable everyone's access to the application, no matter their technical skill level. Yes, the design was successful and is easy to understand and navigate.

---How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached by making as much clean code as possible and ensuring modularity in the code so that it would be easy to use in the future. This applies to many future projects and is a standard in the field.

---How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

When adding coding, I manually tested the application every time and fixed any bugs immediately. This is important to prevent further bugs and break already functional aspects of the application.

---Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I innovated during the event creation phase by utilizing a separate page for creation, giving the application a much simpler look and keeping it nontechnical friendly.

---In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The login page is a good example of using an SQL database to hold user information and grabbing that information to log in.
